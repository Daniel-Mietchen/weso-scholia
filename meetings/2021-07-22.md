## Disscusions
- In order to obtain data from MongoDB we cannot perform requests directly to it from the client. For now, we are going to build a simple node.js backend that accesses to MongoDB.

## Done

- Finished the cacher script which saves the results of a query in MongoDB. A collection per query, a document per parameter.

## Tasks

- Measure the cache, both in build time and size, for unordered subsettings.
- Node.js backend for MongoDB.
