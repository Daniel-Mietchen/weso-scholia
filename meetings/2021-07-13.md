## Done

- Pablo
Working with cached solution set. [Insert to](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/blazegraph/database/wiki/SPARQL_Update). We consider 3 alternatives
    - 1.- Store result sets in a non-RDF format 
        - Pros: 
            - Performance
            - More _Traditional solution 
        - Cons: 
            - Charts like Bubble charts wouldn't improve, they would still need to work against the actual Wikidata endpoint
            - Or, we would need to see if those charts can be adapted to work on that format
            - Or, it would require to use a different visualization library
        - Action: 
            - We would need to see where is the code that generates those charts
    - 2.- Store the result sets in RDF (Blazegraph)
        - Pros:
            - Follow existing approach
        - Cons:
            - Would the charts work?
    - 3.- Store the result sets in a local wikibase
        - Pros:
            - Follow Wikibase approach
        - Cons: 
            - Would require to change the SPARQL queries

- Jorge 

    - Problems with performance measurements
    - Store the subset ordered?
        - Store ordered triples of subqueries
        - Challenge:
            - Final size of so many intermediate results
    - Wikibase = SQL + Blazegraph
        - End results 

```sparql
INSERT INTO  %test
SELECT ?author WHERE {
    SELECT DISTINCT ?author WHERE {
      SERVICE <https://query.wikidata.org/sparql> {
          ?author wdt:P27 | wdt:P1416/wdt:P17 | wdt:P108/wdt:P17 wd:Q32 .
      }
  	}
    ORDER BY ?author
    LIMIT 1000
    OFFSET 3000
}

SELECT ?author
WHERE {
    INCLUDE %test
}
  
```

    - Problems with dump...another solution proposed by Adam to run it outside of the container to avoid active session
    - Caddies arrived so we will have now 14Tb!!!
    
- Labra
    - [wdsub](https://github.com/weso/wdsub)
        - Works with minimal ShEx
        - Pending: 
            - Link to ShEx parser
            - Generate JSON dump
            - Upload JSON dump to a local wikibase instance
            - Slurp with ShEx
            - Graph traversal to obtain a new subset?
                - GraphX (Spark)
        - Issues
            - It uses only one core


```
<City> {
  wdt:P31 [ wd:Q515 ] ;
  wdt:P17 [ wd:Q29  ]
}
```

## Tasks

- Research where is the code that generates bubble charts
- Action: Performance numbers of alternative store. Benchmarks?
    - 93 million of entities
    - MongoDB ?
    - Neo4J ?
    - . . .
- Action, Guillermo. Upload a simple JSON dump
    - [Example dump](https://github.com/weso/wdsub/blob/master/modules/wdsub/src/resources/sample-dump-20150815.json.gz)
