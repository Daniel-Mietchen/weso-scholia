# Meeting 06-Agosto-2021

## Attendees 

- Guillermo
- Jorge

## Done
- Now the Mongo database is able to store results from all sizes. Jorge used GridFS API in mongo to divide the files in chunks. The retrieval of those splitted files does not change. Works like magic.
- Changed the cacher so that offset is parametrized in order to process results in smaller chunks when necessary (Q30)

## Tasks
- Wirte the North America results in the excel file
- Test ideal Q30 offset.
