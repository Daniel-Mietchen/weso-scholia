- Jorge
- labra
- Dani

## Done

- Labra
    - Refactor wdsub to use [Fs2 library](https://fs2.io/) and [cats.effect IO](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/).
    - 2 problems to solve by now
        - Doesn't parse well some chars...generates long error messages in the log that we should suppress
        - Doesn't make use of all the cores available
    -  [Code](https://github.com/weso/wdsub/blob/master/modules/wdsub/src/main/scala/es/weso/wdsub/IODumpProcessor.scala#L48)
    - Reading this post about what happens in [Wikibase when you edit an item](https://addshore.com/2021/07/what-happens-in-wikibase-when-you-make-a-new-item/)
    - Guillermo says that in order to import from a dump, we need TTL serialization. Labra thinks it should be possible using JSON serialization...do some research on this.  
- Jorge is working on caching results and importing them to MongoDB
    - [Script](https://github.com/weso/weso-scholia/tree/master/cacher) to extract authors from country using Node
    - Seems to avoid IP blocking configuring headers accordingly
    - Open questions?
        - Size of cached data
        - Performance improvements (time) over existing approach
- Pablo is working on visualizing data using stored data
    - The library works without using WDQS
    - [See issue](https://github.com/weso/weso-scholia/issues/19)
- Guillermo is working on creating our local wikidata query 
    - It adapted this [script](https://github.com/weso/weso-scholia/blob/master/docs/deploy-wikidata-copy-locally.mdhttps://github.com/weso/weso-scholia/blob/master/docs/deploy-wikidata-copy-locally.md) from Adam
    - Issue: 29.8 days estimation loading times?
        - Some guess: the container is running in a different machine with low bandwidth/latency

## Tasks

- Guillermo to do more research about importing from JSON
- Jorge, connect cached data to MongoDB script
- Guillermo check if performance of script improves using more bandwidth
- Pablo will work on creating a demo for country-authors and automate the process
