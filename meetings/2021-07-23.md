## Done

- Tested the caching system with the 27 countries of the European Union. Acceptable size, time may be excessive -as expected, anyway-.
- The akka streams implementation of wikidata dumps processor finished within 53995 seconds (15 hours). The logs show that only 10M elements were processed but this number might not be genuine at all.

## Tasks
- Reproduce the base experiment of akka streams to test if the original figures match.
- Keep the original JSON format in the cache for mapping purposes.
- Check the entirety of Scholia and ponder how many queries would actually need to be cached.
