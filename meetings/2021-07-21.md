## Done
- Stopped the loading script in the _Ciencias_ machine and launched again in the _Vald√©s Salas_ servers.
- Research about how load JSON in WQS. The described process by Addam states that the JSON dump is just a processable copy of the rdf data. I will continue to find if there's any way to load it in BZ or WQS. 

## Tasks
- Continue working on previous day tasks.
